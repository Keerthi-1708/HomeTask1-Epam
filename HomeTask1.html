            New Delhi: The government today raised interest rates on most post office saving schemes by up to 0.7 per cent 
            for the April-June 2023 quarter in line with the firming of interest rates in the economy.While the interest 
            rates for popular PPF and savings deposits have been retained at 7.1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, 
            there has been an increase between 0.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent in other saving schemes, a finance ministry

            The downturn in the job market has not affected demand for talent at the top.Executive search firms said they are 
            still seeing a strong inflow of CXO hiring mandates. While there has been some cooling-down in sectors such as 
            consumer Internet and hiring by multinational tech firms, that has been offset by high demand from manufacturing,
            industrial and infrastructure companies, new-age sectors and life sciences and pharma.At Korn Ferry, demand for
            CXO hiring is 15-20% above last year. “Some sectors such as industrial and manufacturing are at an all-time high.
            Even newer sectors such as EVs, solar and hydrogen are seeing good demand, so are life sciences, pharma and financial
            services,” said Navnit Singh, chairman and regional managing director at Korn Ferry. “Indian tech companies are still 
            hiring. MNC tech players have slowed down for the moment but will come back in another quarter,” Singh added.

            IPL 2023: After a five-wicket loss at the hands of Gujarat Titans in the IPL opener at Ahmedabad, Chennai Super Kings Head 
            Coach Stepehn Fleming said that expecting MS Dhoni to be as quick as he was at the peak of his career wouldn’t be fair.
            Ahead of the game, there were question marks about Dhoni playing in the opener match on Friday due to a knee injury but the
            coach clarified that it was just cramps and not a knee injury.“He was always playing. Not sure where that story came from.
            He was nursing a sore knee throughout the month of pre-season, but today it was just cramps, it wasn’t the knee,” Fleming 
            said in the post-match press conference.
